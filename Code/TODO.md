## Think about metric for summary (symbolic papers, blue and red)

We can use weak constraints to rule out certain summaries.

## Ideas for learning

- Recognize start and end of process -> do not talk about intermediate steps

## For next time

- Make baseline of 10,000 stories to sentence as NN (hope ASG is more interesting summary than encoder-decoder, find good metric for classification to measure semantic closeness of summaries maybe using ConceptNet)
