We can use weak constraints to rule out certain summaries.

## Ideas for learning

- Recognize start and end of process -> do not talk about intermediate steps

## TODO

- Run NN examples in NN
- Start to collect results for report (may take time)
- ASG not necessarily fast than NN, but more accurate
- Use stricter ASG for summary generation to enforce grammar
- Final goal: take story-specific ASG and general rules to generate summaries
