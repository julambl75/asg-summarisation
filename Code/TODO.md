We can use weak constraints to rule out certain summaries.

## Ideas for learning

- Recognize start and end of process -> do not talk about intermediate steps

## TODO

- Take Matthew example and simplify ASG to make work
- 2 ASGs: less strict for learning actions, very strict for generating summaries

- Start to collect results for report (may take time)
- Final goal: take story-specific ASG and general rules to generate summaries, then use top 5/10
