Jack wants to build a birdhouse. He gets some wood.
He gets some nails and paint.
His mom helps too.
She gets a saw and a hammer.
She gets a pencil and ruler.
Jack draws his birdhouse. They build it together. Then they hang it up in a tree.
A bird goes into the bird house.
A second bird goes in. A third bird goes in.
A fourth bird goes in!
Jack and his mom look at each other.
They need a bigger birdhouse!
