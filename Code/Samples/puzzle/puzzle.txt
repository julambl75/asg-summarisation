Anna and her family love doing puzzles. Anna is best at little puzzles.
Anna and her brother work on medium size puzzles together. Anna's brother likes puzzles with cars in them.
When the whole family does a puzzle, they do really big puzzles. It can take them a week to finish a really big puzzle. Last year they did a puzzle with 500 pieces!
Anna tries to finish one small puzzle a day by herself. Her puzzles have about 50 pieces.
They all glue their favorite puzzles together and frame them. The puzzles look so nice on the wall.
