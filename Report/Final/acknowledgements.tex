        Firstly, I would to thank my supervisor Prof. Alessandra Russo, as well as my co-supervisor David Tuckey, for the time you have put into this project. Week after week, we have had very interesting discussions in which you have provided your respective expertise in logic programming and NLP, helping to move the project forward. I would also like to thank Mark Law for creating ASG, as well as helping we with some of the syntax and numerous optimizations. In addition, I would like to thank my Personal Tutor, Antonio Filieri, for providing advice and guidance throughout the four years at Imperial. Finally, I am grateful for my family, who supported me during my studies.
