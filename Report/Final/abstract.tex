To this day, text summarization remains a largely open-ended problem in Natural Language Processing, and is most often resolved using some form of Machine Learning.

In this project, we aim to resolve the problem for short texts about a paragraph in length, via a novel approach that makes use of Answer Set Grammars. By combining ideas from the fields of logic-based learning, knowledge representation and linguistics, we have created a system that is capable of producing partially abstractive, generic and informative summaries, as well as scoring them by order of pertinence and information density.

The approach chosen for this project relies on a central context-free grammar as its internal representation for a simplified version of the English language. Using Answer Set Programming the system is able to perform logic-based learning after preprocessing the input text, the result of which then goes through a number of summarization logic rules, producing a set of possible summaries.
