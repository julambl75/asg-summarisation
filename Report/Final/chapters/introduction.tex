\section{General Problem}

In general, the task of summarization in NLP (natural language processing) is to produce a shortened text which covers the main points expressed in a longer text (given as input). In order to do this, a system performing such a task must analyse/process the input to be able to extract from it the most important information.

\section{Specific Problem}

Given a brief paragraph of text, for example a short story aimed at young children, we should be able to provide a summary in multiple sentences. The goal here is to extract the most important information from all the relevant sentences, and from this generate one or more grammatically-correct summaries.

This should be accomplished with the use of Answer Set Grammars (ASG), although pre- and/or post-processing may be required.

\section{Objectives}

In all of the problem cited above, should keep the below objectives in mind.

\begin{objective}[Proper Nouns]
When our program encounters a proper noun, it must be able to relate it to other words in the text, by knowing what type of word it is and also having a bit of background knowledge about it. For example, in the text ``He went to Paris yesterday. He arrived in France, then he travelled across the city to his hotel.", our system would need to relate the words ``Paris", ``France" and ``city", but keep ``hotel" as a distinct entity.
\end{objective}

\begin{objective}[Periphrasis]
At the very least, our solution must be able to link synonyms, such as ``house" and ``home". On a more advanced note, it might hopefully also have enough semantic analysis capabilities to know that ``To the left of the goat is a pig." and ``To the right of the pig is a goat." mean the same thing.
\end{objective}

\begin{objective}[Negation]
We should try to make our program able to interpret sentences which involve negation, which can be tricky for a semantic analysis tool. On a basic level we should be able to relate a negated word with its antonym, for example ``not happy" with ``sad" or ``unhappy".
\end{objective}

\begin{objective}[Event Chronology]
Understanding the order of events in a story extremely important, as getting this wrong could make an entire summary incorrect. In order to achieve a good understanding of this, our program must be able to interpret connectives as well as time markers. A good example for the former would be ``He washed his hands and then ate". As a stretch objective, if a text contains the string ``Today is Monday. In two days she has an exam.", our solution should be context-aware and know that the exam is held on a Wednesday.
\end{objective}

\begin{objective}[Sentence Subject]
Aside from our program being able to identify the subject of a basic sentence, it should also be able to understand which sentences have the same subject, so that it can link actions and descriptions with subjects. In passage ``John likes music. He has a guitar", our solution should be able to pick up on the fact that John has a guitar.
\end{objective}

\begin{objective}[Adjectives And Adverbs]
When a sentence contains adjectives and/or adverbs, the program should be able to know what subjects or actions they apply to. The following is an extremely difficult but all-encompassing example: ``The white cat quickly jumped over the brown squirrel who was slowly eating a fresh cobnut".
\end{objective}

\begin{objective}[Context]
A solution must be highly context-aware, and use the correct definition of a word depending on the context. For example, the word ``address" can either be a verb meaning ``to speak to", or the location of a physical place.
\end{objective}
