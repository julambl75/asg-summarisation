\section{Architecture Overview}

The main pipeline, which performs story summarisation, is made of three main steps: the Preprocessor, multiple calls to ASG, and finally prost-processing and scoring (as seen in Figure \ref{fig:main_pipeline}. A description of each step can be found in the following chapters.
