\section{Architecture Overview}

The central part of the pipeline, which performs story summarization, revolves around the ASG task of \textsc{SumASG}. To build on top of this foundation, we first have the \textsc{Preprocessor}, as well as some final post-processing and scoring mechanisms. We will call this augmented task \textsc{SumASG*}, and describe each step in the following chapters. A diagram of the entire pipeline can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:main_pipeline}.

\section{Initial Motivation}

Given plenty of time and a large amount of training data in a specific format, a neural network is able to closely approximate the definition of a summary.

In contrast, using logic means that we can hard-code this definition directly into our program. By carefully constructing its structure, we can get results with just a short list of rules, and know that it will always produce a complete and valid output.

\section{Example}

Throughout this paper, we shall be using the example of the story of Peter Little to illustrate the different steps of our pipeline, as shown below in Figure \ref{fig:peter_little}.

\begin{figure}[H]\
\begin{subfigure}{\textwidth}
\begin{displayquote}
There was a curious little boy named Peter Little. He was interested in stars and planets. So he was serious in school and always did his homework. When he was older, he studied mathematics and quantum physics. He studied hard for his exams and became an astrophysicist. Now he is famous.
