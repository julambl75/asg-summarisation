\section{Achievements}

\textsc{SumASG*} is a symbolic system which is able to generate \textit{generic}, \textit{informative} and partially-\textit{abstractive} summaries given a simple story about a paragraph in length.

Internally, it relies on the ASG engine, which is used for both for understanding text and creating summary sentences. This is an \textit{entity level} approach to the task of text summarization, whereby the \textsc{Preprocessor} makes use of the \textit{similarity} between words and sentences, and creates a \textit{text relationship map} to aid in simplifying the given input story.

The core accomplishments of this project are the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Created a context-free grammar that models the structure of basic English sentences, and can be used both for semantic learning, as well as generating grammatically-correct text.
\item Implemented an algorithm that dramatically reduces the complexity in the structure of English sentences, without losing too much information.
\item Implemented an algorithm which uses \textit{similarity} to remove irrelevant sentences from a short story.
\item Implemented a scoring mechanism prioritizing information density, while taking into account words which may appear frequently in English, can be considered as the \textit{topic} of the original text.
\item Created a framework to automatically generate topical short stories for evaluating the system, based on a dataset of words and a particular sentence structure.
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}

Text summarization is a highly involved task in NLP, bringing together many different fields of study. For this reason, there any many ways in which we could take this project forward, the most beneficial of which we shall discuss in what follows.

\subsection{Support For More Complex Structures}

\subsection{Better Semantic Understanding}

\subsection{Automatic Leaning of Summary Generation Rules}

\subsection{Performance Improvements}

As we have seen, runtime is one of the major bottlenecks of \textsc{SumASG}.
