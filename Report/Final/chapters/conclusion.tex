\section{Achievements}

\textsc{SumASG*} is a symbolic system which is able to generate \textit{generic}, \textit{informative} and partially-\textit{abstractive} summaries given a simple story about a paragraph in length.

Internally, it relies on the ASG engine, which is used for both for understanding text and creating summary sentences. This is an \textit{entity level} approach to the task of text summarization, whereby the \textsc{Preprocessor} makes use of the \textit{similarity} between words and sentences, and creates a \textit{text relationship map} to aid in simplifying the given input story.

The core accomplishments of this project are the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Created a context-free grammar that models the structure of basic English sentences, and can be used both for semantic learning, as well as generating grammatically-correct text.
\item Implemented an algorithm that dramatically reduces the complexity in the structure of English sentences, without losing too much information.
\item Implemented an algorithm which uses \textit{similarity} to remove irrelevant sentences from a short story.
\item Implemented a scoring mechanism prioritizing information density, while taking into account words which may appear frequently in English, can be considered as the \textit{topic} of the original text.
\item Created a framework to automatically generate topical short stories for evaluating the system, based on a dataset of words and a particular sentence structure.
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}

Text summarization is a highly involved task in NLP, bringing together many different fields of study. For this reason, there any many ways in which we could take the overall pipeline forward, the most beneficial of which we shall discuss in what follows.

\subsection{Better Semantic Understanding}

By way of the \textsc{Preprocessor}, \textsc{SumASG*} is able to transform complex sentence structures into simple ones. Unfortunately, this comes at the cost of removing connectors, as well many auxiliary clauses whose structure \textsc{SumASG} cannot parse.

By doing so we can lose some information, or worse: convey a false meaning due to the intricacy of English semantics. To illustrate this, consider the following story:

\begin{displayquote}

\end{displayquote}

This would require changes at all levels of the pipeline.

\subsection{Longer Stories}

As we have seen, runtime is one of the major bottlenecks of \textsc{SumASG}.

\subsection{Domain-Specific Understanding}

There are many domains where a certain background knowledge is assumed, such as research papers in Computer Science. A possible improvement to \textsc{SumASG*} could be a suite of \textit{extensions}, each providing background knowledge...

\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\hl{TODO}}}

- domain-specific, not scalable
- longer text
- more complex structure
- better verification methods
- better understanding of connectors and chronology
- more efficient
