\section{Overview}

Once we have obtained potential sentences from ASG to be used in a summary, we can now post-process these as explained in Section \ref{sec:summary_creation}. By combining them in different ways, we are able to form summaries. From these, we will retain the highest scoring ones, according to the metric detailed in Section \ref{sec:scoring}. A diagram illustrating these steps is shown below in Figure \ref{fig:postprocess_pipeline}.
