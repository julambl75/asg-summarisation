One day, a monster came to our classroom. He didn’t know any of the rules!
We had to show him how to sit on the carpet. We had to show him how to use a quiet voice. We had to show him how to use supplies.
We went to P.E. class. Monster tried to sit on the carpet. No, Monster! We don’t have to sit on a carpet in the gym! Monster tried to use a quiet voice. No, Monster! We don’t have to be quiet in the gym. Monster didn’t know what to do with the supplies. We showed him how to throw a ball.
We went to the lunchroom. Monster sat at a table. Good job, Monster! Monster used a loud voice. No, Monster! We can’t be too loud in the lunchroom. Monster tried to throw his food. No, Monster! We can’t throw food. Monster was confused. Poor Monster.
We went to our classroom. We wrote the rules for the different places at school. Rules are different in different places. It is tricky but it keeps us safe!
