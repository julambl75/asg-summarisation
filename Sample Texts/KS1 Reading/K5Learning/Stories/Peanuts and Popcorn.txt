John is going to a baseball game with his aunt. He can’t wait to get there. It is the first game of the season. The stadium is almost full.
He loves to watch baseball, but his favorite part of going to games is eating the snacks. There are many different snacks at baseball games.
A man in a red hat walks up and down the aisles selling peanuts and popcorn.

John likes them both. He especially likes mixing peanuts and popcorn together. If he is really hungry he will have a hot dog.
