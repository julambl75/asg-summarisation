Brad loves to play video games. His favorites are Disney games.
Brad got home from school one day, and his mom asked him if he had homework. He did, but he thought about saying no because he wanted to play his games.
Then he changed his mind. He knew that if he lied, he would lose his games for a week.
He did his homework first and still had time to play two games before dinner. He knows it is best to be honest.
