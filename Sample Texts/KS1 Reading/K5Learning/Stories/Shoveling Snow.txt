I want a new toy. Mom says toys cost money. How can I get money? I look outside. There is a lot of snow!
Mom says I can earn money if I shovel our driveway. I do. It is fun! I do not have enough money for my new toy.
I look around. Mrs. Jen has a shovel. Can I shovel her driveway? She says yes! I almost have enough money for my new toy.
Mr. Tom has a shovel. Can I shovel his driveway? He says yes! I can get my new toy!
