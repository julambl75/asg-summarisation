The kids were outside playing catch. They heard a rumble in the sky.
They didn’t want to stop playing, but they knew it wasn’t safe to be out in a storm. Also, they did not want to get wet.
They decided to go inside and play a board game. They loved listening to the thunder as they played their game.
The kids went outside again after the storm had passed. They saw a rainbow!
