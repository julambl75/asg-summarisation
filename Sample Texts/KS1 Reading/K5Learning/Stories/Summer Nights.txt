It is nighttime in the summer.
Luke, Jake and Connor look up at the sky. Jake sees the Milky Way. Luke points to the moon. It is a half moon. Connor looks at all of the bright stars.
After they study the sky, they collect fireflies in a jar. They hear an owl hoot loudly from a nearby tree.
The boys love being outside on summer nights. They sleep in a tent so they can stay out all night.
When they are ready to go bed, they climb into the tent and use the fireflies as a nightlight.
They let the fireflies go in the morning so they can catch them again the next time they sleep outside.
