First, make an “X” with the laces. Take the bottom lace and put it in the space between the shoe and the middle of the “X.” Pull the
ends of both laces tight.
Next, make a loop with each lace. Make an “X” with both loops. Take the bottom loop and put it in the space between the shoe and the middle of the “X.” Pull both loops tight.
Last, do the steps again with the laces on your other shoe. Pat yourself on the back. You tied your shoes!
It will take you a few times to get it right. Keep on practicing!
