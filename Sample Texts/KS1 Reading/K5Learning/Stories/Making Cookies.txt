Greg likes to help his mom make cookies. Chocolate chip cookies are his favorite. His mom likes them too.
He adds the chocolate chips to the batter. Then he stirs them in. He forms the batter into balls
and places them on a baking sheet. His
mom places the baking sheet into the
oven.
When the cookies are in the oven, Greg licks the last bits of batter from the bowl. He can hardly wait for the cookies to be ready.
In 30 minutes the cookies are finished baking. The cookies are hot and yummy.
