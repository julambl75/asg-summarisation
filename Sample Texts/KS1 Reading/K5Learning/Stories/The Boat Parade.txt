The boats are floating along the lakeshore. It is the summer boat parade.
There are motorboats, rowboats and sailboats.
Jessica’s favorite is the yellow motor boat with the flag. The rowboat decorated with flowers is Lisa’s favorite. Tony likes the purple sailboat.
The boats float by one at a time. The people on the boats waive at the crowds. The crowds cheer the boats.
The boat parade is so much fun to watch. It is the best part of the summer.
