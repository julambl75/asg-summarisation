My family just adopted a puppy and a kitten from the animal shelter. They were so young, they did not even have names yet. We had to think of good names for them.
The puppy likes to jump up. The kitten likes to curl up in our laps.
“What do you want to name them?” asked Mom.
My sister said, “Pounce for the puppy and Cuddles for the kitten.”
We all thought those names were perfect.
