On a hot day, a group of children were sitting by a pond. They wanted to have some fun. They took off their shoes and put their feet in the pond. They splashed around a little. After a while, they got bored.
Just then an old man walked by. One of the children said, “Let’s have some fun with him!” They all laughed and planned to play a trick on him.
The children
called to the
man, “Oh
uncle! Please, come
here. We have a big problem!”
The old man walked over to the children. He looked worried and he wanted to help the children. “What is it?” he asked.
“Our feet are tangled. We cannot tell whose feet belong to who!” The children giggled and winked at each other.
The old man was wise but also kind.
He understood that the children were not serious. He did not get angry or scold the children. Instead, he played along. He said, “That sounds like a serious problem, but I think I can help.”
The old man found a long stick. Then he came back to the pond and tickled the children’s feet with it.
Each child whose feet he tickled would start laughing loudly. The child would laugh so hard that he would roll out of the water. One after another, the children and their feet rolled out of the pond.
“There, I have solved your problem!” said the wise man.
