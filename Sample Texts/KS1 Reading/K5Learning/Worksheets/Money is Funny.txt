Mary saw her mom spend money on groceries. She saw her dad spend money on new tools. That all seemed funny to Mary.
“Money is just green paper,” Mary thought. “Why do people give my parents groceries and tools for green paper?”
Mary took out her big box of crayons. She colored some paper green. She took her green paper to the toy store in town.
“I want to buy a toy,” Mary declared. “Here is some green paper.”
The lady at the store said “Sorry. That's not real money. It is just green paper.”
Mary asked her dad about money. He said that money was a special type of green paper. He also said you have to go to work to earn money. That is the only green paper you can spend.
“Can I work and earn some money?” Mary asked.
“Yes,” said her dad. “Wash the car, and I will pay you.”
Mary washed the car and got paid six dollars. She went back to the store and bought a toy.
Now she knows why her mom and dad work for money.
