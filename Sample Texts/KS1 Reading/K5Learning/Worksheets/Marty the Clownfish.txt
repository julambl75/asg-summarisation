Marty was sad in the sea. As a clownfish, he felt like he should be funny. As a clownfish, he wasn’t funny.
He wasn’t funny at all. He was very serious and didn't make anyone laugh.
He told jokes to the lionfish, but they didn’t laugh. He told jokes to the
dogfish, but they didn’t
laugh either.
“I’m a clownfish and I should be funny,” Marty said aloud.
“You don’t have to be funny,” said a shark from nearby. “You are kind and helpful. You are friendly and smart.”
“But clowns make people laugh, so a clownfish should make fish laugh,” said Marty.
“The lionfish don’t act like lions. The dogfish don’t act like dogs,” the shark told him.
“Marty, just be yourself.”
So Marty did just that. He stopped trying to tell jokes. Soon, the fish all liked him. Soon, he had a lot of fish friends.
One day, Marty said, “I’m going to tell you all a joke.”
“Marty, no! No more jokes!”
Marty said, “Just kidding!”
