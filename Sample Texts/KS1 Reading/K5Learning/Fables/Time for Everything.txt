There’s a time to run and a time to walk.
There’s a time for silence and a time for talk.
There’s a time for work and a time for play.
There’s a time for sleep at the end of the day.
There’s a time for everything you do, For children and for grown-ups too. A time to stand up and a time to sit, But see that the time and actions fit.
