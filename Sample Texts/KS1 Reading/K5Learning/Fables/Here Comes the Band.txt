Here comes the band! Should we call Mommy and Fanny to see it?
Let us stand still and hear the men play as they pass.
I hope they will stop here and play for us.
See the large man in front of the band with his big hat?
Whatâ€™s he holding in his hand? How fine he looks!
Look at the man on that fine horse too.
If the men do not stop, let us follow them and see where they go.
