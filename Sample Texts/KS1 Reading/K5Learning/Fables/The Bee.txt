“Come here, Lucy, and listen! What is in this flower?”
“Oh Mother! It is a bee. I wonder how it got caught inside the flower?”
“It went into the flower for some honey, and maybe it went to sleep. Then the flower closed it in.”
“The bee likes honey as we do, but it does not like to be closed in the flower.”
“Shall we let it out, Lucy?”
“Yes, then it can go to other flowers and get honey.”
