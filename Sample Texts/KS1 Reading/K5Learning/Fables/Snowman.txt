“Roy, did you make that snowman?” “Yes. Doesn’t he look funny?”
“He is a funny snowman, Roy. What a big nose he has and big eyes too! Won’t he fall down?”
“No, I put some water on him. The water froze, and that holds the snow.”
“Aren’t you very cold, Roy?”
“Yes, come, let us have a good run, and that will make us warm.”
