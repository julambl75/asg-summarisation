Susy Brown is a good girl.
Some of her friends were going to the woods to pick berries, and Susy wanted to go
with them. However, when Susy came
home from school, she found her mother tired and worn out from her work.
Susy took the baby and said she would stay at home and let her mother rest.
When the girls came home with their berries, they all gave Susy some.
Everybody loves Susy.
